    <h2>Work and Data Experience</h2>
    <p>    
    After working in childcare and fundraising after graduating from Gonzaga University I recently spent a year working in data entry and database management using the CRM software "Raiser's Edge", entering all donations into the database and ensuring accurate financial and contact information for current and potential donors. This experience piqued my interest in data more broadly, so I took a Data Analytics bootcamp through UC Berkeley where I practiced both back-end coding and data analytics as well as some front-end web development. My non-profit roots continue to lead me towards data in the social world in fields like healthcare, housing, and wealth inequality. This diverse set of work experiences has allowed me be flexible and adaptible when encountering new and unfamiliar material and tasks.
